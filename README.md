# warp_alignment

This project is a realization of the paper "WARP: On the Benefits of Weight Averaged
Rewarded Policies": https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.16768.

It contains the whole WARP algorithm training:

Moreover, there is a report where all the experiments are described in detail. It contains both the original implemetation from the paper and some attempts
to improve the received result.

The final WARP weights that give the best reward are stored in the file "warp_model.pth".
